The Station is Now Live!

Welcome everyone! 

Today is the day that I begin advertising and getting this radio on some directories, if this is your first time here I'll briefly explain a few things:

---

- What is the purpose of this radio?
To broadcast a wide variety of tracks from all of my favorite genres (but mostly Gabba) and hopefully to entertain others in the process!

- What is the time zone of your schedule?
We run on Mountain Time.

- Why does your station have "commercial breaks"?
Radionomy has a rule to have a break every 30 minutes, these breaks only last 2 minutes and contain short ads which vary depending on where you are in the world. If your country is not specified by Radionomy to contain ads, then a short 2 minute "Ad Filler" will play.

- What is DSI?
DSI, or DarkShark Industries, is the Oldschool Gabber record label I'm proud to be a member of! <a href="https://darksharkindustriesigl.bandcamp.com/">Check them out here</a> to hear our latest release, or to send us a demo if you also like 90s Gabba and would like to join us!

- How long is your station live?
24/7, as long as our internet radio service doesn't go down, and if it does the radio should be back online in about a couple hours to a day.

- Do you make any money from this?
Nope, making a radio station has been a dream of mine since I was a kid, I don't plan on making this for profit.

- What is this "Special Sunday Event"?
Every Sunday there will be 9 and a half hours of pure 90s Gabber, from 10:30-20:00. However, some Sundays may have a pre-recorded podcast where I, and/or someone else, can showcase a new mix they've created! 

It can last anywhere from 15 minutes to 4 hours. If you want to have your stuff broadcasted here, send me the .mp3 file at my email, Sefbrodz@yahoo.com, I allow any musicstyle for mixes, so don't worry if it's not Gabber ;) I will make an alert 1 week in advance with a video on my Youtube channel and in the news page of this website, so there's no way you can miss it!

I hope that clears any confusion, if you still have more questions feel free to ask me with the links in the Contacts page!
