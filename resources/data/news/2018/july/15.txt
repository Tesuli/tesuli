The Station is Now Live!

Welcome everyone! Today is the day that I begin advertising and getting this radio on some directories, if this is your first time here I'll briefly explain a few things here:

---

What is the purpose of this radio?
To broadcast a wide variety of tracks from all of my favorite genres (but mostly Gabba) and hopefully to entertain others in the process!

What is the time zone of your schedule?
We run on Mountain Time.

How long is your station live?
24/7, as long as our internet radio service doesn't go down, and if it does the radio should be back online in about a couple hours to a day.

What is DSI?
DSI, or DarkShark Industries, is the Oldschool Gabber record label I'm proud to be a member of! <a href="https://darksharkindustriesigl.bandcamp.com/">Check them out here</a> to hear our latest release, or to send us a demo if you also like 90s Gabba and would like to join us!

Why does your station have "commercial breaks"?
Radionomy has a rule to have a break every 30 minutes, these breaks only last 2 minutes and contain short ads which vary depending on where you are in the world. If your country is not specified by Radionomy to contain ads, then a short 2 minute "Ad Filler" will play.

Do you make any money from this?
Nope, making a radio station has been a dream of mine since I was a kid, I don't plan on making this for profit.

What is this "Special Sunday Event"?
Every Sunday there will be 9 and a half hours of pure 90s Gabber, from 10:30-20:00. However, some Sundays may have a pre-recorded podcast where I, and/or someone else, can talk about anything music-related. It will probably only last 30-60 mins at most, and I will alert anyone who's interested 1 week in advance with a video on my Youtube channel and in the news page of this website.
