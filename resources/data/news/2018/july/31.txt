God I love Jungle, don't you?

There's just something so peaceful yet chaotic, so mellow yet insatiable, so calming yet fierce... as if the entire genre were a metaphore for life.

I love Gabber music above all else though, nothing can beat the artistic chaos and messege of this music. Although, if there was 1 genre that could get close to getting the best of Gabber... Jungle would be it.

What a fuckin ride.
